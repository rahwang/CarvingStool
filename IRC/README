This is a simple IRC server which implements basic functionality including registration, private messaging, channels and modes for multiple clients.

Runs on port 7776 by default.

To test on local host, start the server by running 'make' then 
'../chirc -o INSERTOPERATORPASSWORD'.

Open a connection as a client with telnet,
'telnet localhost 7776'.
