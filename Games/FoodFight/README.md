# Food Fight!

A simple button game with the simple premise, what if food came to life? It features adorable art, animations and music by [my talented teammates](http://phillydevnight.com/events/recent/what-if-jam/). My friend AJ and I handled the gameplay programming and game design.

This game was the winning entry for the two-week [What-If Game Jam](http://phillydevnight.com/events/recent/what-if-jam/) with [Philly Dev Night](http://phillydevnight.com/).

## Rules
Spawn as many food minions as possible! Standard food minions fight evenly in each lane. After a certain number of button presses, chefs will spawn super minons that can take lots of extra damage.

## Controls

P1: QWE

P2: IOP

In the Menu screen, use Q/E and I/P respectively to switch chefs.
