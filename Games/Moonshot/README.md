# Moonshot

Moonshot is a variant of Pong using planets and a moon instead of paddles and a ball. 

## Rules
### Pong Mode
Each planet attracts the moon with its gravitation force -- the nearer to the moon, the greater the force exerted. Players score points by slingshotting the moon into their opponents goal. However, if a player's planet touches the moon, their opponent gets a point, so players must carefully manage their distance.
### Dodgeball Mode
Avoid the moons for as long as possible! Planets' gravitational force increases over time.

## Controls
