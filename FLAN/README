Here is a glimpse at some code I've written for 'FLAN', a fingerspelling data annotation website created by Jon Keane for his work on ASL at the University of Chicago. It can be found here:
http://meta.spc.uchicago.edu/

Included here are two images of the FLAN site, as well as a php file implementing all of the search functions that query our database, the core of the site.

Unfortunately, FLAN is down at the moment, due to some structural changes we've made to the database. Further examples will be available as soon as the site goes back online.

I have spent about a year maintaining, updating, and adding functionality to FLAN, to the point where it's difficult to point to which code is purely mine, and which is Jon's. As an example of work I am sure is 100% mine, see lines 773-863 in allSearches.php. This chunk of code implements a special diagram that displays apogee position and duration in a single instance of a finger-spelled word.
